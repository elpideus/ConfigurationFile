# ConfigurationFile
This java project has a class that is the project. The name of the .java is configureFile. 
Once you create the object in your Main you can use the methods to manage the data.In the project you can see how i use the class in the mani file.You can also see the config.yml example

This is a beta and i have to optimise some methods. In the future i will add the possibity to add lists, arrays and objects, but it is difficult to handle.

If you find any bug contact me :)
